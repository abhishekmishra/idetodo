-- The IDETODO config file is a LUA program which returns
-- table instance whose keys are configuration params for
-- the program.
--
-- Being a LUA program this provides enormous flexibility
-- to modify the behaviour of the main application.
--
-- However with such flexibility comes the possibility of
-- a larger surface area of mistakes. Be careful, start
-- with small changes and once you are confident that
-- you understand the workings of the configuration system
-- only then make larger changes. Therefore to start with
-- do not change the first line (declaration of the cfg
-- object), and the last line (which returns the cfg object).
-- Initially just edit this as you would change other
-- properties files.
--
-- When you are more confident with LUA syntax and the
-- configuration system, you can add more ambitious changes.

-- If you modify this line you must modify the rest of the
-- config file. Read the blurb above.
-- tldr; Do NOT change this line

-- If you modify this line you must modify the rest of the
-- config file. Read the blurb at the top of the file.
